For example, we may wish to find a minimum cost route subject to a total time constraint in a multimode transportation network. Furthermore, the problem, which is shown to be at least as hard as NP-complete problems, is generic to a class of problems that arise in the solution of integer linear programs and discrete state/stage deterministic dynamic programs. One approach to solving the problem is to utilize a kth shortest path algorithm, terminating with the first path that satisfies the constraint. This approach is impractical when the terminal value of k is large. Using Lagrangian relaxation we propose a method that is designed to reduce this value of k. Computational results indicate orders of magnitude savings when the approach is applied to large networks.}

	abstract = {The shortest path problem is one of the classic network problems. The objective of this problem is to identify the least cost path through a network from a pre-determined starting node to a pre-determined terminus node. It has many practical applications and can be solved optimally via efficient algorithms. Numerous modifications of the problem exist. In general, these are more difficult to solve. One of these modified versions includes an additional constraint that establishes an upper limit on the sum of some other arc cost (e.g., travel time) for the path. In this paper, a new optimal algorithm for this constrained shortest path problem is introduced. Extensive computational tests are presented which compare the algorithm to the two most commonly used algorithms to solve it. The results indicate that the new algorithm can solve optimally very large problem instances and is generally superior to the previous ones in terms of solution time and computer memory requirements. This is particularly true for the problem instances that are most difficult to solve. That is, those on large networks and/or where the additional constraint is most constraining.},

	abstract = {We propose a packet switched platform for single chip systems which scales well to an arbitrary number of processor like resources. The platform, which we call {Network-on-Chip} {(NOC)}, includes both the architecture and the design methodology. The {NOC} architecture is a m times;n mesh of switches and resources are placed on the slots formed by the switches. We assume a direct layout of the {2-D} mesh of switches and resources providing physical- and architectural-level design integration. Each switch is connected to one resource and four neighboring switches, and each resource is connected to one switch. A resource can be a processor core, memory, an {FPGA}, a custom hardware block or any other intellectual property {(IP)} block, which fits into the available slot and complies with the interface of the {NOC.} The {NOC} architecture essentially is the onchip communication infrastructure comprising the physical layer, the data link layer and the network layer of the {OSI} protocol stack. We define the concept of a region, which occupies an area of any number of resources and switches. This concept allows the {NOC} to accommodate large resources such as large memory banks, {FPGA} areas, or special purpose computation resources such as high performance multi-processors. The {NOC} design methodology consists of two phases. In the first phase a concrete architecture is derived from the general {NOC} template. The concrete architecture defines the number of switches and shape of the network, the kind and shape of regions and the number and kind of resources. The second phase maps the application onto the concrete architecture to form a concrete product},

L'objectif de cette th{\`e}se est de proposer une nouvelle m{\'e}thode de test pour les r{\'e}seaux sur puce asynchrones. Afin de faciliter le test de l'infrastructure du r{\'e}seau, nous avons tout d'abord propos{\'e} une architecture {DfT} {(Design-for-Test)} dans laquelle chaque routeur du r{\'e}seau est entour{\'e} d'un wrapper de test asynchrone qui am{\'e}liore sa contr{\^o}labilit{\'e} et son observabilit{\'e}. Cette architecture {DfT} a {\'e}t{\'e} mod{\'e}lis{\'e}e, impl{\'e}ment{\'e}e en logique asynchrone {QDI} {(Quasi-Delay} Insensitive), et valid{\'e}e avec un r{\'e}seau sur puce asynchrone {ANOC} d{\'e}velopp{\'e}e au {CEA-LETI.} La g{\'e}n{\'e}ration des vecteurs de test a {\'e}t{\'e} alors faite en analysant les fonctionnalit{\'e}s et l'impl{\'e}mentation structurelle du routeur et de ses interconnexions. Ensuite, nous avons {\'e}galement introduit une strat{\'e}gie pour tester un r{\'e}seau complet. La m{\'e}thode de test compl{\`e}te d{\'e}velopp{\'e}e dans cette th{\`e}se permet une couverture de faute de 99,86\% pour le r{\'e}seau {ANOC} en utilisant un mod{\`e}le de faute de collage simple.}

Interconnection systems became a pivotal component of the overall design, providing designers with advanced communication features such as split transactions, atomic operations and security adds-on. Momentum is building behind Networks on-chip {(NoC)} as future on-chip interconnection technology. Networks on-chip role is about to take over shared busses whose scalability properties are already a major bottleneck for system design. Modeling of on-chip network is an exacting work ; networks models must be fast, accurate and they have to sport standard interfaces. The main contributions of this work to networks on-chip design and implementation are : (1) the development of a brand new, full-fledged network on-chip simulator based on {OCCN}, an open-source framework for {NoC} modeling developed within sourceforge available at http://occn.sourceforge.net, (2) the successful integration of heterogeneous simulation environments in extremely complex platforms used to benchmark real {STMicroelectronics} {SoCs} and (3) thorough understanding and contribution to the design of {STNoC}, the new interconnection technology developed within {AST} Grenoble lab of {STMicroelectronics} for future generation systems. The modeling environment has been used to benchmark two {STMicroelectronics} systems on-chip for High Definition digital Television {(HDTV).}}

	abstract = {The topological structure of interconnection networks plays an important role in the design of {Networks-on-Chip} based Systems. With an enormous number of regular and irregular topologies, acquiring the optimum network topology for a specific application is one of the most complex design problems. In this paper, we propose a new design methodology to automatically acquire the most adapted topology for a given application. A Matlab-based tool called {OptNoC} is developed to generate the interconnection network using the proposed methodology. The granularity of the {OptNoC} library facilitates a tool to explore ten different topologies for each design. The current version of the tool mainly aims at minimizing the interconnection network power consumption by using an exhaustive search mapping technique. As a proof of concept, a case study is discussed to show how {OptNoC} can improve the interconnection network power consumption compared to other tools.},

	abstract = {We address the design of complex monolithic systems, where processing cores generate and consume a varying and large amount of data, thus bringing the communication links to the edge of congestion. Typical applications are in the area of multi-media processing. We consider a mesh-based Networks on Chip {(NoC)} architecture, and we explore the assignment of cores to mesh cross-points so that the traffic on links satisfies bandwidth constraints. A single-path deterministic routing between the cores places high bandwidth demands on the links. The bandwidth requirements can be significantly reduced by splitting the traffic betweenthe cores across multiple paths. In this paper, we present {NMAP}, a fast algorithm that maps the cores onto a mesh {NoC} architecture under bandwidth constraints, minimizing the average communication delay. The {NMAP} algorithm is presented for both single minimum-path routing and split-traffic routing. The algorithm is applied to a benchmark {DSP} design and the resulting {NoC} is built and simulated at cycle accurate level in {SystemC} using macros from the ×pipes library. Also, experiments with six video processing applications show significant savings in bandwidth and communication cost for {NMAP} algorithm when compared to existing algorithms.},

In this paper, we present {SUNMAP} a tool for automatically selecting he best topology for a given application and producing a mapping of cores onto that topology. {SUNMAP} explores various design objectives such as minimizing average communication delay, area, power dissipation subject to bandwidth and area constraints. The tool supports different routing functions (dimension ordered, minimum-path, traffic splitting) and uses floorplanning information early in the topology selection process to provide feasible mappings. The network components of the chosen {NoC} are automatically generated using cycle-accurate {SystemC} soft macros from X-pipes architecture. {SUNMAP} automates {NoC} selection and generation, bridging an important design gap in building {NoCs.} Several experimental case studies are presented in the paper, which show the rich design space exploration capabilities of {SUNMAP.}},

To interconnect the {IPs} of these heterogeneous platforms, {Networks-on-Chip} {(NoC)} have been proposed as an efficient and scalable alternative to shared buses. {NoCs} can provide throughput and latency guarantees by establishing virtual circuits between source and destination. State-of-the-art {NoCs} currently exploit {Time-Division} Multiplexing {(TDM)} to share network resources among virtual circuits, but this typically results in high network area and energy overhead with long circuit set-up {time.We} propose an alternative solution based on Spatial Division Multiplexing {(SDM).} This paper describes our first design of an {SDM-based} network, discusses design alternatives for network implementation and shows why {SDM} should be better adapted to {NoCs} than {TDM} for a limited number of {circuits.Our} case study clearly illustrates the advantages of our technique over {TDM} in terms of energy consumption, area overhead, and flexibility. {SDM} thus deserves to be explored in more depth, and in particular in combination with {TDM} in a hybrid scheme.},
