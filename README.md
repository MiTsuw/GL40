/////// SUMMARY

Student project about HMI and perception. We were given an ap on which we had to improve the HMI. We were to study the old interface and design a new one which responded to current standards. We added the Leap Motion as a new peripheral available at use in the app.
We used Qt with CUDA toolkit, OpenGL and boost as extern librairies.
